[Lesson 1: Welcome to Comments]

Welcome, my friend, to Python! Python is (at present) my favorite programming language. It's...well, very cool. As you are new to programming in general, I have devised a series of very mini mini-lessons to give you a bit of a handle on things, ordered by Lesson #...

Welcome to Lesson 1! This lesson is all about comments, to give you an understanding of the structure of these mini-lessons.

In programming-speak, a comment is a line of code that goes un-executed, and is used to give clarity on what code actually does.

There are 2 types of these comments:
    - Block Comments
    - Line Comments

For instance, this entire block of text is surrounded by 2 pairs of triple quotes--as such, everything inside it is NOT RUN when the program does. You can test this by pressing the play button here, which should run the program:
"""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass

"""
See? Nothing happened! 

Of course, you don't always need a 40 line introduction to explain your code. For this, you use a single line comment. In Python, this comment is far more typical, and denoted by a hash symbol: #
"""
#Like so! This line will also not run not run!
"""
More common than a long explanation, you "comment out" a line of code that you want to temporarily NOT run. For example, this is a line of code which has been commented out. Try removing the comment in front of it out to see what happens.
"""
#Objective: Make the following print statement work correctly
#print("You are super cool")
"""
The above line introduced the print statementâ€”this is the most common way to output text to the Python "console," which is where all output statements go. Try making your own print statement down below! If you want a real introduction to programming, the true first thing most programmers do ('tis tradition) it to print "Hello, World!" So, take a stab at it!
"""
#Objective: Make "Hello, World!" print to the console



"""
And with that, you're officially a programmer!

Just kidding, with that you've mastered lesson 1, and should hopefully understand comments (block and single line) and the print statement. Next, we'll introduce variables and if statements. See you there!
